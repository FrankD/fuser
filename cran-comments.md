## Test environments
* Linux Mint 18 Sarah,  R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note
checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  5.2Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs   5.0Mb

* This seems unavoidable due to use of package Rcpp.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
